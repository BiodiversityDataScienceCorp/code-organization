Repository for showing "good enough" practices for code organization


This repository provides a model for code structure, based upon [Good enough practices in scientific computing, by Wilson et. al](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).


We've largely been using R Notebooks for coding, which is fine for tutorials and such, but probably isn't the best for sharing and reproducability.
